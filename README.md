# Football-analysis
 2 day data viz project with football data.

 In this project I analized football data from the top 5 leauges in Europe for the season 2022-2023. Then I tried to find two good signings based on that data.

 Skills that was practised during this project was data collecting and cleaning, visualizations, and data analysis.

 The data was collected from FBRef with Pandas read html method. Then it was cleaned in several steps. When that was done, I started to scatterplot data to find outstanding players, and then used those players to do some more plotting and analysis to find the best potential signings for an imaginary club.
